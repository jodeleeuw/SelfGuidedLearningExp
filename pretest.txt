1.  5 students in a math class take an exam.  Their scores, out of 10 problems, were: Jane = 8, Frank = 3, Erica = 2, John = 4, Don = 8What are the median and mean for this data set?A) median = 5, mean = 4B) median = 4, mean = 5C) median = 2, mean = 4D) median = 2, mean = 5(correct answer: B)2.  Imagine a math exam in which 15 students do very well, getting scores of 98, 99, and 100 out of 100 possible points.  However, the remaining 3 students get very poor scores: 5, 8, and 9.  Will the mode be less than or more than the mean? A) the mode will be more than the meanB) the mode will be less than the meanC) the mode and mean will be the sameD) more information is needed about the particular scores(correct answer: A)3.  For this same situation, which will be higher: the median or the mean? A) the median will be more than the meanB) the median will be less than the meanC) the median and mean will be the sameD) more information is needed about the particular scores(correct answer: A)4.  5 lamps are assessed for their quality by running them through a battery of 10 tests.  Here are the number of tests that each of 5 lamp models passed: Vegas = 8, Galaxy = 9, Pinto = 4, Lumus = 9, Corinth = 5.What are the median and mean for this data set?A) median = 7, mean = 8B) median = 4, mean = 8C) median = 4, mean = 7D) median = 8, mean = 7 (correct answer: D)5.  If most lamps pass about the same number of tests, but one lamp passes far fewer tests, will this lampâ€™s performance affect the mode or the mean more?  A) the mode will be affected more than the meanB) the mean will be affected more than the modeC) the mode and mean will be equally affectD) more information is needed about the particular scores(correct answer: B)6.  Will the poorly performing lamp affect the median or the mean more?A) the median will be affected more than the meanB) the mean will be affected more than the medianC) the mean and median will be equally affectD) more information is needed about the particular scores(correct answer: B)
